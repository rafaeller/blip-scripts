blip-scripts is a repo with my python automation scripts. Trying to make BLIP easy again.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all of libs used in the scripts.

An example is [blip-session](https://github.com/chr0m1ng/blip-session) that provide a session class from requests module to use as a BLIP Session.

To install use:
```bash
pip install blip-session
```
